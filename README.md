## BinGo: Visual Concurrency Debugger for Go

**BinGo** is a standalone visual concurrency debugger for Go that makes goroutines, channels, and synchronization behavior easy to understand.

It captures detailed runtime events and transforms them into clear, interactive visualizations, whether you’re using a terminal UI or working inside editors like **VS Code** or **Vim**.

### Key Features:

* 🧵 **Goroutine lifecycle tracking**
* 📡 **Channel and mutex inspection**
* ⏱ **Timeline replay of concurrent execution**
* 🚨 **Deadlock and goroutine leak detection**
* 🖥 **Terminal UI and editor integrations**

### Designed for Extensibility

BinGo’s modular, **UI-agnostic core engine** makes it easy for the community to build new frontends and integrations without touching the runtime analysis logic.

**See how your concurrent programs actually behave, not just how you think they do.**
